  # Scalatra = Scala + Sinatra

  <dfn>Scalatra</dfn> is a tiny, [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)-like web
  framework for [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

  ## Why Scalatra?

  - *Lightweight*: Scalatra is not a full application stack.  It is a simple DSL
    for dispatching HTTP requests to Scala code blocks.  The rest of your
    architecture remains up to you.

  - *Scalable*: Scalatra will grow with your application from a single-file
    prototype to a multi-tier enterprise application.

  - *Familiar*: [Similar DSLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_%28software%29#Sinatra_inspired_frameworks)
    exist in many other languages.  Scalatra is a very comfortable way for users
    of those frameworks to explore the power of Scala.

  - *Java-interoperable*: Scalatra can call your existing Java libraries and
    deploys to your favorite servlet container.  Migrate from Java at your own
    pace.

  - *Vibrant*: Scalatra has an active [community](community.html) of users and
    contributors.  Come join us.
