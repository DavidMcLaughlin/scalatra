# Scalatra = Scala + Sinatra

<dfn>Scalatra</dfn> is a tiny, [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)-like web
framework for [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).  

## Why Scalatra?

- *Lightweight*: Scalatra is not a full application stack.  It is a simple DSL
  for dispatching HTTP requests to Scala code blocks.  The rest of your
  architecture remains up to you.

- *Scalable*: Scalatra will grow with your application from a single-file
  prototype to a multi-tier enterprise application.

- *Familiar*: [Similar DSLs](http://gist.github.com/353559) exist in many other
  languages.  Scalatra is a very comfortable way for users of those frameworks
  to explore the power of Scala.

- *Java-interoperable*: Scalatra can call your existing Java libraries and
  deploys to your favorite servlet container.  Migrate from Java at your own
  pace.

- *Vibrant*: Scalatra has an active [community](community.html) of users and
  contributors.  Come join us.

## Example

    import org.scalatra._

    class ScalatraExample extends ScalatraServlet {
      get("/") {
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      }
    }
